  abstract = {Es wird die Hypothese vertreten, daß die regelhaften jahreszeitlichen Änderungen der Phasenbeziehung zwischen Aktivitätsrhythmik und natürlichem Licht-Dunkel-Wechsel auf der Grundlage spezieller Synchronisations-mechanismen erklärt werden können. Im Teil 1.1 werden die endogenen und exogenen Faktoren besprochen, die theoretisch die Phase zu beeinflussen vermögen. Die Überlegungen führen zu dem Schluß, daß das Licht-Dunkel-Verhältnis und die Dauer der Dämmerung im wesentlichen die Phase bestimmen. Experimentelle Belege sind in Teil 1.2 enthalten. In Teil 2 werden Freilandbeobachtungen über Beginn und Ende der Aktivität von Vögeln neu ausgewertet. Diese Ergebnisse, wie auch Meßwerte der Aktivität von Tieren in Innenräumen (Teil 3), stützen die Hypothese. Sie zeigen alle maximal voreilende Phasen im Mittsommer bei tagaktiven Arten bzw. im Mittwinter bei einer nachtaktiven Art. Einige, in Teil 4 erwähnte Ausnahmen von dieser Regel, werfen die Frage auf, in welchem Ausmaß die Ergebnisse verallgemeinert werden dürfen. In der Arbeit werden auch die einheitlichen jahreszeitlichen Änderungen der Aktivitätszeit erörtert.},

  abstract = {The SPEI database (SPEIbase) provides a comprehensive global record of drought conditions. It offers a standardized measure of drought, the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), computed at multiple time scales ranging from monthly to 48 months. The SPEI index considers both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET), estimated using the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith method. This approach provides a robust and accurate assessment of drought conditions across various regions and timeframes. SPEIbase is freely accessible and can be used to support a wide range of applications, including drought monitoring, risk assessment, and climate change studies. This is an update of the SPEIbase v2.9 (https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/332007).-- What’s new in version 2.10: 1) Based on the CRU TS 4.08 dataset, spanning the period between January 1901 to December 2023.

  abstract = {Logicians have long distinguished two modes of human reasoning, under the respective names of deductive and inductive reasoning. In deductive reasoning we attempt to argue from a hypothesis to its necessary consequences, which may be verifiable by observation; that is, to argue from the general to the particular. In inductive reasoning we attempt to argue from the particular, which is typically a body of observational material, to the general, which is typically a theory applicable to future experience. In statistical language we are attempting to argue from the sample to the population, from which it was drawn. Since recent statistical work has shown that this type of argument can be carried out with exactitude in a usefully large class of cases(2, 3), by means of conceptions somewhat different from those of the classical theory of probability, it may be useful briefly to restate the logical and mathematical distinctions which have to be drawn.},

This deterministic system has collective properties in very close correspondence with the earlier stochastic model based on McCulloch - Pitts neurons. The content- addressable memory and other emergent collective properties of the original model also are present in the graded response model. The idea that such collective properties are used in biological systems is given added credence by the continued presence of such properties for more nearly biological "neurons." Collective analog electrical circuits of the kind described will certainly function. The collective states of the two models have a simple correspondence. The original model will continue to be useful for simulations, because its connection to graded response systems is established. Equations that include the effect of action potentials in the graded response system are also developed.},

Solutions of these equations can be identified with trajectories in phase space. For those systems with bounded solutions, it is found that nonperiodic solutions are ordinarily unstable with respect to small modifications, so that slightly differing initial states can evolve into considerably different states. Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions. A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic. The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results.},

One model is a simulation in which individual members of two recognizable groups distribute themselves in neighborhoods defined by reference to their own locations. A second model is analytic and deals with compartmented space. A final section applies the analytics to ‘neighborhood tipping.’ The systemic effects are found to be overwhelming: there is no simple correspondence of individual incentive to collective results. Exaggerated separation and patterning result from the dynamics of movement. Inferences about individual motives can usually not be drawn from aggregate patterns. Some unexpected phenomena, like density and vacancy, are generated. A general theory of ‘tipping’ begins to emerge.},
